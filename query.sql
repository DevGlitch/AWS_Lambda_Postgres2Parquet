-- This SQL query retrieves data from multiple tables: artifacts, artifact_types, observations, and users.
-- It joins these tables to gather comprehensive information about artifacts and related observations.
-- The query selects various columns from these tables, such as artifact properties, observation details,
-- and user information, and aliases some columns for clarity.
-- This query is used to collect data for further processing in the Postgres2Parquet Lambda Function (lambda_function.py).
