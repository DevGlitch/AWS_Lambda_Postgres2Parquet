# üêò Postgres2Parquet AWS Lambda Function

This repository contains Python code for an AWS Lambda function that connects to an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL database, executes a SQL query, and writes the query result to Amazon S3 in Parquet format. The function is designed to be triggered by an AWS Lambda event.

This function can also be configured to run locally and write the Parquet file to a local folder.

## üöÄ Deploy Parameters

In the GitHub repository Actions secrets, make sure to configure the following secret variables:

| Parameter                 | Description                               |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID**     | AWS access key ID.                        |
| **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY** | AWS secret access key.                    |
| **ENVIRONMENT**           | Name of the environment (`production`).   |
| **DB_NAME_PROD**          | Name of the production database.          |
| **DB_USER**               | Database username.                        |
| **DB_PASSWORD_PROD**      | Database password for production.         |
| **DB_HOST_PROD**          | Database host.                            |
| **DB_PORT_PROD**          | Database port.                            |
| **FILE_NAME**             | Name of the output file.                  |
| **S3_PATH**               | Storage path for Amazon S3 (production).  |

These are used by the GitHub Actions deployment workflow to authenticate with AWS and deploy and publish the Lambda function.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

To use this Lambda function, follow these steps:

1. **AWS Lambda Configuration**: 
    - Create an AWS Lambda function and configure it to trigger based on your use case.
    - Attach an execution role granting database read access and S3 write permissions.
    - Attach the pre-built AWS Lambda Layer with Pandas and AWSWrangler


2. **AWS IAM User for Lambda Deployment**: Create an AWS IAM user with 3rd Party Access with the following inline policy. Make sure to replace the placeholders with your region, account number, and Lambda function name. Also, make sure to create the user's access key ID and secret access key and add them to your GitHub repository Secrets.

```JSON
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "lambda:UpdateFunctionCode",
                "lambda:UpdateFunctionConfiguration",
                "lambda:GetFunctionConfiguration",
                "lambda:PublishVersion"
            ],
			"Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:{REGION}:{ACCOUNT_NUMBER}:function:{LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME}"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
            "Effect": "Allow",

        },
        {

                "lambda:GetLayerVersionPolicy"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:*:{ACCOUNT_NUMBER}:layer:*:*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor3",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [

                "lambda:ListLayers"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

3. **GitHub Repo Secrets**: Set required environment variables in your GitHub repository Actions secrets, including database connection details (e.g., `DB_NAME_PROD`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD_PROD`, etc.), output file name (`FILE_NAME`), storage paths (`S3_PATH`), and AWS Configuration (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`).


4. **SQL Query**: Create your SQL query to be executed by the Lambda function and save it in `query.sql`.


5. **GitHub Actions Deployment**: Automate deployment using GitHub Actions. Push changes to the main branch or trigger events to execute the deployment workflow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy-to-lambda.yml`.

---

## üõ† Usage

Once triggered, the Lambda function connects to the specified PostgreSQL database, executes the SQL query, and writes the result to the chosen storage location (S3 or local). Monitor execution and view errors in the AWS Lambda console.

---

## ‚ùå Error Handling

The Lambda function includes error handling, logging exceptions, and returning a 500 status code with an error message in the response if an error occurs.
